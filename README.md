The image includes an analyzation of a specific song and analyzations on different aspects of the song. This could be used to provide a kind of representation of a song and helps in classifying songs. 

*Ideas of Interest*

1. humanities topics of interests to me: 
* gender studies
* music 
* multicutural studies

2. The topic that most appeals to me is stat & modeling: Making recommendations, predictions, and arguments because it involves using the conclusion we draw from the data to apply them into practical uses.
