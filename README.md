# DH140_final_project

## Overview
[The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection)

* The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) acquired its first artworks in 1929, the year it was established. Today, the Museumâ€™s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art.

* The Artists dataset contains 15,243 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA's collection and have been cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year, Wiki QID, and Getty ULAN ID.

* This project explores the collection and aims to reveal what artworks are more flavored in modern arts, or in this collection, cutting from different aspects such as themes, scales, and gender ratio of the artworks. 

## Research Topic

* Through analysis on the distribution of the artists and different scales of the artwork, this project researches the underlying information in this dataset, and studies implicit determinants that makes an artwork more flavored in modern art. This project focuses on social and economy environment, gender, and nationality of artists to give a general assessment of possible aspects that affects the frequency of appearance of artworks in this collection and explore the underlying reasons for the pervalence of such artworks. 

## Questions

* What makes a certain type of artwork more common in modern arts and in this collection? Is it gender? Is it history backgrounds? Is it nationality, or even the size of the artwork itself? 
* Are there underrepresented groups in this collection? If there are, what are these groups and what might be the cause of the underrepresentation? 

## Motivation

* Through exploring this dataset, I gradually becomes curious about these questions. The dataset itself is too large to find a certain pattern in it, but with the help of tools, it is possible for us to explore the whole dataset in condensed visualizations. 
* Based off the methods we learned in class, I was interested in how mapping and text analysis could be applied in this dataset to visualize some invisible patterns in this dataset and hopefully approach my research questions and provide some insights into what are we seeing and not seeing in seemingly unbiased artwork collections and even some underrepresented artworks and groups in this collection. I hope that this project would allow us to see some implicit factors that are affecting our flavor of artworks, including reasonable factors and underlying biases.
